- Athens -> Istanbul -> Cairo -> Georgia -> Aktu -> Madrid
	- but very dependent on if spain accepts my visa

## Japan Plans

	- prep materials
	- mail spain
		- decide which embassy (barcelona)
		- emphasize urge and the emergency clause
		- emphasize that you’re living in spain
	- decide if we’re gonna go full tourist mode and plan days if spain rejects
	- decide if we’re gonna stay in a country for 14 days and gain a permanent address or a shipping box or smth
		- 3 days to consulate
		- 5-7 days to process
		- 2-4 days to return either to mom or address abroad
- mail for JASSO scholarship
	- cairn
	- hideki
	- other scholarships
	- if i do get a JASSO scholarship, it would be very worth it to stay in a country to get the student visa
