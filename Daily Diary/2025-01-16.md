Today I was in [[../Finland/Helsinki]]

I went to go get a sleeping bag first. Learned that it’s important that you check all options before buying something. As always. But this has doubly reinforced that. I would’ve never gotten a free sleeping bag without it. Furthermore, I wouldn’t have gotten a good discounted sleeping bag without it either.

Furthermore, I went around. Suomenelli island wasn’t that great. Better in the day.

KotKot was some delicious chicken.

Went to Club X. I’d definitely go again. Super cool space. Also, it was cheap. 10E

I went on the train and found 4 french speaking girls, 3 from Belgium (Ghent, Brussels, Small Town) n 1 from France (West Coast near Brit)
