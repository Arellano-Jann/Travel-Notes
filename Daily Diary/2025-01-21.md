Today I missed my train stop. This caused me to detour about 3-4 hours? and waste $20 on a taxi. 

What’s funny is that the town of Ylitornio and Overtornea are less than 20 minutes away from each other but the time difference between both is 1 hour because of the time zones. It makes sense now why google wanted me to walk 40 minutes in the span of the 5 minute difference that it said. I would’ve made it without the taxi tbh. But I would’ve had to walk along the cold bridge with nothing but the frozen lake to my left and right. Crazy how that works.

Anyway, i’m 15 min away from Haparanda, or so the map says.
