Woke up and I’m in Lviv, Ukraine rn. I need to shower. I need to eat. But I’m here troubleshooting Obsidian right now.
Later, I need to fix Dawarich too. Life on vacation is not vacationing. And I’m fine with that. It’s nice needing to do something and improve my skills other than just rotting on Reels.
