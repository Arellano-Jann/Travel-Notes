# What?
- Don’t think I’m going to get checked for bus tickets today in Geneva. Wish i kinda did so i could see how they scan the code.
- Just got caught with the train tickets. They saw that I activated it 2 minutes after the train departed and were ready to fine me. I was about to be so fucked. Switzerland trains don’t fuck w them lol. Luckily they came around checking early or else I really would’ve been fucked. good lessons learned.
- need to look at sex positive in interlaken, como, luzern and zurich
- also need to finish all the data analysis stuff
- got food at the migros, it’s a lil burrito thing. expected it to be cafeteria style but it’s good too ig. 
- interlaken west is closer to midtown than ost/east
