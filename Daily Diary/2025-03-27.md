$50 Per Day, 16 Days, $800, 120K JPY spend
Half that is $400 or 60k JPY. If I can find a solid place for $30 or less per day, thatâ€™s worth it too

Thus I need to find a place cheaper than 120k JPY total.

Prime Asakusa - 89k per month, 10k cleaning fee

Hi! I'm an exchange student at Meiji Daigaku and I wanted to see if this room is still available? I'm looking to move in as soon as possible. I also wanted to know a bit more about the other housemates, amenities and any other information lik e toilet/shower and good/bad things about the room is good to know!This place really seems like a good fit for me right now.

Thank you! Jann
