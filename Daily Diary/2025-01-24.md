Yesterday I thought a lot about sex, my life, and my goals. I’ve figured out that my goal is to have fun and not go around the countries like pokemon cards. This is because I can always go around the countries later but I think that, with my goals, I should go fuck around and find out now rather than later. When I get locked down, either by a relationship and/or my job, I’m not gonna have these opportunities (I’ll have different ones of course). So I need to do what I would not be able to do then, now. That’s the goal I have. 

So anyway, with that sin mind. I’m going to go to Georgia and Aktau, the beach cities, I’m gonna see if I can visit Kygyrstan or smth. and then that’ll be my trip for central asia. 3 countries. and then I might come back to europe so I can score a cheap bangkok flight, or figure out my way from central asia to china/beijing/hk to bangkok.
I think my entrypoint is bangkok and my exit point is 100% shanghai into japan. 
China’s visa free is extended so I can rlly just go places without a visa which is lit. I’m going to try to avoid visa countries like india if I can help it. I’m not too excited to go there and I would rather spend it in Europe rather than there. It would make my trip look so cool though. But that’s it. Fun > cool right?
