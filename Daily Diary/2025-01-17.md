Some things about Rovaniemi:

	- I’ll grab enough to last 2 meals just in case
	- grabbing: crackers, yogurt, charcuterie, jerky, bread?
- I’m gonna find a sauna/shower
- I’m going to finish my HW
- i’m gonna book a 50E bus to levi and sleep in a shelter there if I’m fine tonight
- I may book the 100E waterfall hike or a 100E snowmobile tour
- I will look at snowmobile rentals and how much they cost. If I can do one for a day and sleep with it, that’s worth at least 200E
