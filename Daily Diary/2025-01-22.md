I want to write more about my travels.

My favorite part is Finland so far and I think it’s because of the nature. I wish to do this trip again but focus on the nature aspects. I have focused too much on the city (I think) and not enough on events and nature. Sure the city is cool but there’s some cities and places which are just “ok” and the nature is better. However, I will give myself a pass since it is winter and nature in the winter is snowyyyy and not that nice. The good parts are up north which I was at.

Thus, I’d like to do this trip again. 3 months. Summer. Start in the balkans and end in the nordics for the winter.

Man… will I have time to do that?
