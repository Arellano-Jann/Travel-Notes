# Thoughts? What? Tips?
- oversized baggage usually comes out of the baggage claim first. or its because i was first to check in. either way, makes sense. i’ll check on this after i land
- do not check in a bag if you’re seeing transferring and there’s less than 2 hours between the times. security, bag claim, taxi, immigration, and everything else takes a lot of time.
- At TIA, the above was manageable at 11am and i had about an hour to spare but it’s a close call fs.
- 5 euros for a bus Venice to Treviso and 5 more euros for airport bus from treviso to airport
