## Apps
All are necessary but you can really just do with Omio and BlaBlaCar if you really wanted to.
For trains, the best option is to download the country specific app. For example, in the Baltics, the trains don’t show.

| App          | Bus | Train | Plane |
| ------------ | --- | ----- | ----- |
| Omio         | X   | X     |       |
| FlixBus      | X   |       |       |
| BlaBlaCar    | X   | X     |       |
| Rail Planner |     | X     |       |
| DB Navigator |     | X     |       |
| GMaps        | X   | X     | X     |
| Apple Maps   | X   | X     |       |
*Notes*
- FlixBus, oftentimes, does not appear on any of the other apps.
- Rail Planner does not show every train but most trains.
- You should download the countries specific train app for the full list.
- DB Navigator is more extensive than rail planner but it’s (ofc) not as extensive as the country specific app.

### Steps
1. Check GMaps for the route to get to your destination. Grab the departure and arrival station names.
	1. Oftentimes, it shows the best route via bus (and trains too probably)
2. Check Omio, BlaBlaCar, Flixbus with the departure and arrival stations.
3. Check Rail Planner with the same stations.
4. Check the country-specific app with the same stations.
5. Voila, you have noted down all of the ways to get to your destination.
