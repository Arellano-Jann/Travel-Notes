1. Get the interrail map that shows the whole coverage
2. Pick a starter country
	1. Optimal starter countries are the very extremes from the north or the south-east.
	2. For example, Greece/Istanbul or, UK or, Amsterdam, or Switzerland (?)
	3. If given the chance, Iâ€™d start in Istanbul or Greece first.

*Notes*
- Do not travel using Interrail in Portugal, Spain, Italy, or France.
