[![Notes/#*Table]]


So, we have around 14 days, until Feb 15, to arrive in Turkey. This is around 4/5/6 cities
Between Bucharest and Sofia, I’d pick Bucharest. However, if Bucharest doesn’t fit, then definitely do Sofia.
We also need to start booking my flights.
Route 1 (5) - Fly into Athens, Train to Thessaloniki, Skopje, Sofia, Istanbul
Route 2 (5) - Fly into Beograd, Skopje, Athens, Thessaloniki, Istanbul 
Route 3 (3)2 - Fly into Bucharest, Sofia, Istanbul
Route 4 (3) - Athens, Thessaloniki, Istanbul
Route 5 (4) - Athens, Thessaloniki, (Strimon, Kulata, Sofia), Istanbul
Depending on the route we take, we will have extra interrail passes left over. Thus, do not be wary of wasting a pass day.
We have to decide on which route we’ll take based on what Yang says. Optimally, we 0meet in Istanbul but I do want to do Greece with her. Furthermore, the best option seems to be Route 1 or 2 which both use 4/3 pass days respectfully.

Copenhagen -> London 16E
London -> Geneva 23E
Cons: Lose a day or 2
Pros: See Yang, More money

Copenhagen -> Geneva 80E
Cons: Lose 40E
Pros: More time

Ljubljana -> London
London -> Athens
