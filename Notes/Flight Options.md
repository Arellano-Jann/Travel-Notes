### Thoughts

- Remember that you can’t buy any of these flights until you get your visa in Japan sorted out. Maybe it’s coming from Barcelona but you probably can only get it in Spain.
- Shanghai - Tokyo on Mar 23/24 is around $111 and $115
- It’s really hard to get into asia from central asia by flight. you kinda have to go through india. do i wanna go through india?
- Bangkok has good international connections to europe (incl dubai + mumbai)
- Singapore has dubai + mumbai
