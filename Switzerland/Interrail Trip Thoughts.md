So I fly into Geneva and we need to find a way to Ljubljana

The best scenic routes I’ve found are:
- Bernina Express (Chur - Tirano)
	- Sit on the right side (From north to south)
- Brig - Chur - Tirano (Part of Glacier Express)
- Tirano - Como - Zurich
	- Ferry across Como from, Colico, Bellano, Varenna?
- RHB Network (Rhatische Bahn)

There’s a place called Machete - Burrito Kartell that’s supposedly really good.

We also have this map.

Currently we’re thinking:
- (Geneva -> Bern) -> (Interlaken) -> (Brig -> Chur -> Tirano -> Como) -> (Luzern) -> (Zurich) -> Lichtenstein -> Ljubljana
