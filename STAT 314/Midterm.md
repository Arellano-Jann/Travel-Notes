## **Questions**

### **1. Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.**
- **Question:** Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False 

Question 1 - Lesson 14: The Standard Normal Distribution
Solution: This is true because it is a bell curve, highlighted by “standard normal density.” For example, if it was skewed, there is no guarantee that the half of the datapoints would be below the mean.
Answer: True

### **2. A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, n, increases.**
- **Question:** A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, $n$, increases.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

It’s more precise because there are more samples.

---

### **3. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.**
- **Question:** The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

This is true because as the p-value gets smaller, we say that there is either (convincing < .01, moderately suggestive < .05, slightly suggestive < .10) evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. And if it is below the alpha value, we can reject the null hypothesis.

### **4. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.**
- **Question:** If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

Mutually exclusive means that they cannot occur at the same time.
Independent means that they do not affect each other.
While, to me, it may seem true at first, if they cannot occur at the same time, then that means that they are affecting each other in some way.

### **5. The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.**
- **Question:** The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

X bar means sample mean
p hat means sample proportion

Population parameters - $\micro$, $p$, $\sigma$
Sample statistics - $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}$, $s$

---

### **6. When n is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean p and standard deviation $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.**
- **Question:** When $n$ is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

Also called standard error, as n increases, the variability of the sampling dist decreases.
E(x) = $\micro$
SD(x) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

I actually have no idea about this.

- **Question:** What is the probability X will be less than 1.2?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. 0.634**  
  - b. 0.421  
  - c. 0.579  
  - d. 0.113  

Question 20 - Lesson 8: Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Solution:
Since we know the CDF from the previous question, we can calculate this easily. We take the CDF since it’s *cumulative* and takes the area corresponding to the left side. Since we are calculating the probability that X will be less than 1.2, this matches up perfectly. Thus we can just substitute the value in. If we had the wrong CDF, then this would also be wrong so it’s important to integrate properly while keeping in mind the limits. I mistakenly put the CDF as $-x^{-3}$ the first time and got this one wrong in my corrections too because of that. So be careful!

- **Question:** Lionfish are native to indo-pacific waters but the fish were introduced into the Atlantic in the 1990s. These spiny fish have huge appetites, feed on native species, and have and typically have an average length of 13.5 inches. Recently, invasive Lionfish were found 300 feet below the water’s surface off of the coast of Florida. There was some speculation that these fish were larger than previously observed. A random sample of 25 lionfish was obtained close to Fort Lauderdale. The length of each specimen was recorded in inches. The data below shows the distribution of fish lengths. Use the plot and the R output to answer whether there is evidence to suggest the true mean length of Lionfish in this area near Florida is greater than the 13.5. Use a significance level of .05 and assume the underlying population is normal. Describe the distribution using context and terms for the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** The length of Lionfish near Florida is centered above 13.5 inches, with slight positive but overall symmetric distribution. The length of Lionfish near Florida ranges approximately from 5 inches to 27.5 inches.

### **57. State the null and alternative hypothesis for the appropriate hypothesis test.**
- **Question:** State the null and alternative hypothesis for the appropriate hypothesis test.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:**  
    \[
    H_0: \mu = 13.5 \, \text{inches}, \, H_a: \mu > 13.5 \, \text{inches}
    \]

### **58. Checking Conditions.**
- **Question:** Checking Conditions.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:**  
    - **Random Sample:** Stated in the problem.  
    - **Normal population or sample size large:** Sample size less than 30, but population is normal! So okay! And histogram is relatively symmetric!

### **59. Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.**
- **Question:** Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:**  
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times \frac{4.40}{\sqrt{25}}$
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times .88$
    $16.28 \pm 1.82$
    **95% CI:** (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches)  

Question 59 - Lesson 28: Estimation: The Population Mean
Solution:
We use the formula for t confidence intervals below since we don’t know $\sigma$:
$$\bar{x} \pm t_{n-1,a/2}\times\frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}$$
For a 95% confidence interval and 24 df, our t crit value would be 2.064. I had trouble calculating this with R using `qt(97.5,24)` because it gave me NaN’s so I just used the t-table provided in week 5. However, let me remind you that it’s 97.5 because $2.5 \times 2 = 5$.
From reading the problem, we know that $n=25$ because there are 25 lionfish in the sample.
Afterwards, we are given all of the values so we can just sub the values in appropriately. $${16.28} \pm 2.064\times\frac{4.4}{\sqrt{25}}$$
$${16.28} \pm 1.816$$
Answer:
For a 95% confidence interval, $[14.464, 18.096]$

### **60. Summarize your conclusions in the context of the problem.**
- **Question:** **Summary:** There is convincing evidence that the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches (alternative hypothesis). We reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level (p-value = 0.002). The 95% confidence interval for the mean length is (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches), and the point estimate is 16.27 inches, indicating that the true mean length is likely between 14.46 and 18.10 inches.
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** There is convincing evidence the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches. The sample estimates the average Lionfish to be 16.27 inches with a 95% confidence interval from 14.46 inches to 18.10 inches. The null hypothesis is rejected. The one-sided t-test resulted in a significant p-value of 0.002 from a test statistic of 3.16 with 24 df.
