## **Questions**

### **1. Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.**
- **Question:** Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False 

Question 1 - Lesson 14: The Standard Normal Distribution
Solution: This is true because it is a bell curve, highlighted by “standard normal density.” For example, if it was skewed, there is no guarantee that the half of the datapoints would be below the mean.
Answer: True

---

### **2. A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, n, increases.**
- **Question:** A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, $n$, increases.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

It’s more precise because there are more samples.

---

### **3. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.**
- **Question:** The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

This is true because as the p-value gets smaller, we say that there is either (convincing < .01, moderately suggestive < .05, slightly suggestive < .10) evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. And if it is below the alpha value, we can reject the null hypothesis.

---

### **4. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.**
- **Question:** If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

Mutually exclusive means that they cannot occur at the same time.
Independent means that they do not affect each other.
While, to me, it may seem true at first, if they cannot occur at the same time, then that means that they are affecting each other in some way.

---

### **5. The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.**
- **Question:** The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

X bar means sample mean
p hat means sample proportion

Population parameters - $\micro$, $p$, $\sigma$
Sample statistics - $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}$, $s$

---

### **6. When n is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean p and standard deviation $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.**
- **Question:** When $n$ is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

Also called standard error, as n increases, the variability of the sampling dist decreases.
E(x) = $\micro$
SD(x) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

I actually have no idea about this.
So $p$ is proportion and this talks about it. We know that when n is alrge, np and n(1-p) must be $\geq$ 10. Thus, we can say the the distribution is normal and has a mean of p, along with the standard deviation stated.

### **7. Which Venn Diagram correctly depicts $P(A) = 0.30$, $P(B) = 0.40$, $P(A \text{ AND } B) = 0.15$?**
- **Question:** Which Venn Diagram correctly depicts $P(A) = 0.30$, $P(B) = 0.40$, $P(A \text{ AND } B) = 0.15$?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. Diagram 1  
  - b. Diagram 2  
  - **c. Diagram 3**
  - d. Diagram 4

Remember that outer circle + inner circle/middle must equal the total probability.

---

### **8. What is the probability either A or B or both events occur?**
- **Question:** What is the probability either A or B or both events occur?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.70  
  - b. 0.85
  - **c. 0.55**  
  - d. 0.45  

This is a classic A union B. I think that Bayes theorem is “what is a chance of A given that B happens (A|B)”
We can get the formula for P(A U B). It’s P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). We have all the venn diagrams we need here

Use the following to answer the next 2 questions. 
An injection molding process for making detergent bottles 
uses three different machines the table gives the distribution for the number of machines operating at any given time
y_i 0 1 2 3
P(y_i) 0.020 0.030 0.200 0.750
### **12. Find the probability that 2 or fewer machines are running at the same time.**
- **Question:** Find the probability that 2 or fewer machines are running at the same time.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.200  
  - b. 0.050  
  - **c. 0.250**  
  - d. 0.75  

$.02 + .03 + .2 = .25$

---

### **13. Find the standard deviation of machines running.**
- **Question:** Find the standard deviation of machines running.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.398  
  - **b. 0.631**  
  - c. 2.68  
  - d. 7.98  

${\sigma}^2 = V(x) = E(x^2) - |E(x)|^2$
$\sigma = \sqrt{V(x)}$

$E(x) = 0 + .03 + (2*.2) + (3*.75) = 2.68$
$E(x^2) = 0 + .03 + (2^2*.2) + (3^2*.75) = 7.58$
$V(x) = 7.58 - 2.68^2 = .3976$
$\sigma = \sqrt{.3976} = .631$

Use the following to answer the next 2 questions. 
Solar-heat installations successfully reduce the utility bill 
60% of the time. Suppose 10 houses with solar-heat installations are selected at random and the outcome between houses is independent. Suppose X is the number of houses that successfully reduced the utility bill out of the 10. 
n = 10, binomial, 60% true, 
### **14. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?**
- **Question:** Solar-heat installations successfully reduce the utility bill 60% of the time. Suppose 10 houses with solar-heat installations are selected at random and the outcome between houses is independent. Suppose X is the number of houses that successfully reduced the utility bill out of the 10. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Binomial**

It’s a true or false scenario. Therefore, it’s binomial.

---

### **15. What is the probability that at least 9 out of 10 solar-heat installations are successful?**
- **Question:** What is the probability that at least 9 out of 10 solar-heat installations are successful?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.0464  
  - b. 0.9432  
  - **c. 0.0403**  
  - d. 0.8429  

n = 10, binomial, 60% true, x = 9/10
`dbinom(9, 10, .60)`
$P(x) = p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$
$P(x) = .6^9(1-.6)^{10-9}$

## Use the following to answer the next 2 questions. 
The number of cars entering a roadway at a specific exit during the morning rush hour traffic (6AM to 9AM, M-F) is a random variable with an average of 6 cars per minute. Suppose the number of cars entering the roadway is the random variable X. 
### **16. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?**
- **Question:** The number of cars entering a roadway at a specific exit during the morning rush hour traffic (6AM to 9AM, M-F) is a random variable with an average of 6 cars per minute. Suppose the number of cars entering the roadway is the random variable X. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Poisson**

Poisson models occurrences over time
Binomial models successes over trials (where it’s either yes or no).

Since this is 6 per minute, it’s 6 occurrences per unit of time. Therefore, it’s a poisson structure.

---

### **17. What is the probability the number of cars entering the roadway is between 4 and 6 cars per minute (inclusive)?**
- **Question:** What is the probability the number of cars entering the roadway is between 4 and 6 cars per minute (inclusive)?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.8925  
  - **b. 0.4551**  
  - c. 0.2945  
  - d. 0.1606  

We use the pmf $P(x) = \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}$.
$\lambda = 6$ and $P(4 \leq x \leq 6)$
$$\frac{6^6e^{-6}}{6!}+\frac{6^5e^{-6}}{5!}+\frac{6^4e^{-6}}{4!}=.4551$$
Note that we add the probabilities here because we are using the pmf which calculates for $P(X=x)$ (a point/exact) while the cdf calculates for $P(X \leq x)$. 
We can do `ppois(6, lambda=6) - ppois(3, lambda=6)` if we want to use R and the cdf.

---

### **18. Why is this function invalid?**
- **Question:** Based on the definition of a probability density function, why is this function invalid?  
  $$
  f(y) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{15} \left( 4 - y \right), & \text{for } 1 \leq y \leq 5 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$
- **Answer:**  
  - a. Probability density functions can’t be piece-wise functions.  
  - b. The variable should be x not y.  
  - c. The range of the r.v. can only be from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.  
  - **d. The function does not integrate to 1 over the sample space.**  

Valid PDF’s:
- non negativity for all $f(x) \geq 0$
- total probability must be 1, thus you have to integrate and see if they add up to 1.
Furthermore, the other options are nonsense so it makes sense that this one is the only one that’s correct.

## Use for the next 3 questions
PMF
$$
  f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  3x^{-4}, & x > 1 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

### **19. What is the cumulative density function?**
- **Question:** The random variable X is described by the following pdf:  
$$
  f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  3x^{-4}, & x > 1 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  What is the cumulative density function?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. $F(x) = 1$  
  - b. $F(x) = -x^{-3}$  
  - **c. $F(x) = 1 - x^{-3}$**  <
  - d. $F(x) = 3x^{-4}$  

We integrate here. Remember that you add to the exponent, thus it becomes $x^-3$.
Furthermore, we integrate fully from $1 < x < \inf$ so that’s where we get the 1 from.

---

### **20. What is the probability X will be less than 1.2?**
- **Question:** What is the probability X will be less than 1.2?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. 0.634**  
  - b. 0.421  
  - c. 0.579  
  - d. 0.113  

Question 20 - Lesson 8: Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Solution:
Since we know the CDF from the previous question, we can calculate this easily. We take the CDF since it’s *cumulative* and takes the area corresponding to the left side. Since we are calculating the probability that X will be less than 1.2, this matches up perfectly. Thus we can just substitute the value in. If we had the wrong CDF, then this would also be wrong so it’s important to integrate properly while keeping in mind the limits. I mistakenly put the CDF as $-x^{-3}$ the first time and got this one wrong in my corrections too because of that. So be careful!
$1-(1.2)^{-3}$
$1-(.579)$
$.421$
Answer:
.634

### **21. What value represents the 95th percentile?**
- **Question:** What value represents the 95th percentile?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 2.71  
  - b. 1.65  
  - c. 1.96  
  - **d. 1.17**  

$$x_{95} = .95 = 1-x^{-3}$$
 $$1-.95 = x^{-3} = \frac{1}{x^3} = .05$$
 $$x = \sqrt[-3]{.05}=2.71$$
Make sure to remember the negatives when cube rooting and shit. That’ll fuck u up

## Use the following to answer the next 2 questions. 
The length of time for one individual to be served at a restaurant is a random variable having an exponential distribution with an expected wait time of 4 minutes.
### **22. Find the probability that an individual would wait longer than 10 minutes to be served.**
- **Question:** The length of time for one individual to be served at a restaurant is a random variable having an exponential distribution with an expected wait time of 4 minutes. Find the probability that an individual would wait longer than 10 minutes to be served.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. $\approx$ 0.00  
  - **b. 0.08**  
  - c. 0.94  
  - d. None of the above.  

Pay attention where it says EXPECTED wait time. This means expected value
$E(x)=4$, $\lambda = 1/4$, $x=10$
$P(x>10) = 1-P(x \leq 10) = 1 - F(10)$ 
In R, to use the CDF `1-pexp(10, 1/4)` <- this makes more sense because it finds the area to the right of the curve 
or to use the regular exponential function `exp(-1/4 * 10)`

PDF of exponential $$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$
Integrate f(x) to get cdf$$F(x) = 1- e^{-\lambda x}$$
Add everything up to get $$e^{(-1/4) * 10}= .082$$

## Use the following for the next four questions. 
The Lightning Bolt Electric Car company claims their new car “The Buzzer” can travel on average 170 miles on one charge (𝜇 = 170 𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠). It is known that the population distribution associated with the distance per charge in normally distributed with standard deviation of 30 miles. 
$\micro = 170$, $\sigma = 30$, normal dist
### **24. Draw the distribution. On the axis indicate the mean and $\pm 1$, $\pm 2$, $\pm 3$ standard deviations away from the mean.**
- **Question:** The Lightning Bolt Electric Car company claims their new car “The Buzzer” can travel on average 170 miles on one charge ($\mu = 170$ miles). It is known that the population distribution associated with the distance per charge in normally distributed with standard deviation of 30 miles. Draw the distribution. On the axis indicate the mean and $\pm 1$, $\pm 2$, $\pm 3$ standard deviations away from the mean.  
- **Answer:**  
  \[
  80 \quad 110 \quad 140 \quad 170 \quad 200 \quad 230 \quad 260
  \]
  $\micro = 170$, $\sigma = 30$, normal dist

### **25. Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, approximately the middle 95% of the cars fall between which two values?**
- **Question:** Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, approximately the middle 95% of the cars fall between which two values?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. 110 miles and 230 miles**  
  - b. 140 miles and 200 miles  
  - c. 150 miles and 190 miles  
  - d. 80 miles and 260 miles  

68 is 1 std, 95 is 2 std, 99.7 is 3 std
so the range is $[170-30*2, 170+30*2] = [110, 230]$

---

### **26. Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, approximately what is the percentage of cars that traveled between 170 and 260 miles on average?**
- **Question:** Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, approximately what is the percentage of cars that traveled between 170 and 260 miles on average?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 95%  
  - b. 47.5%  
  - **c. 49.85%**  
  - d. 68%  

Since we’ve figured out that 97% are from 80 to 260 (3std), and 260 is 3std away from the mean, 170, we can say that $95/3 = 49.85$% of cars travel like that

---

### **27. What is the probability a “Buzzer” car will travel more than 250 miles on a single charge?**
- **Question:** What is the probability a “Buzzer” car will travel more than 250 miles on a single charge?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.0267  
  - b. 0.9733  
  - **c. 0.0038**  
  - d. 0.9962  

We need to normalize it to Z first and put that into `1-pnorm()`. Don’t forget that we’re calculating the are on the right side.
$$\frac{\bar{X}-\micro}{\sigma}=\frac{250-170}{30}=\frac{8}{3}$$
`1-pnorm(8/3)` or `1-pnorm(250, mean=170, sd=30)`

---

### **28. Find the 95th percentile for Buzzer car distances.**
- **Question:** Find the 95th percentile for Buzzer car distances.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 230.0 miles  
  - **b. 219.4 miles**  
  - c. 309.7 miles  
  - d. 211.2 miles  

`qnorm(.95, 170, 30)`
Shouldn’t this be 230? lol.

## Use the following to answer the next 4 questions.
A brewery uses a machine to fill 12 ounce bottles of beer. 
Occasionally, they take a random sample of bottles to investigate whether the machine is filling the bottles to the specified amount. The distribution to the right represents the ounces of beer per bottle from a random sample of 30 bottles. 
![[../../Ignored/Pasted image 20250214173936.png]]
### **29. The amount of beer per bottle is a:**
- **Question:** The amount of beer per bottle is a:  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. categorical variable.  
  - **b. quantitative variable.**  

This is a a quantity and not a boolean var.

---

### **30. The population of interest in this example is:**
- **Question:** The population of interest in this example is:  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. the 30 beer bottles sampled.  
  - b. all beer bottles.  
  - **c. all 12-ounce beer bottles filled by this machine at the brewery.**  
  - d. all beer bottles from this brewery.  

This is not A because it’s a population and not a sample. Furthermore, C is the most accurate.

---

### **31. The amount of beer per bottle has a distribution that is:**
- **Question:** The amount of beer per bottle has a distribution that is:  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. perfectly symmetric.  
  - b. bimodal.  
  - **c. moderately skewed to the left.**  
  - d. moderately skewed to the right.  

Look at the tail. The lower end is on the left, so it’s skewed left. Remember the tail is the lower part, therefore the tail is where it’s skewed.

---

### **32. What proportion of the 30 sampled bottles are more than 12 ounces?**
- **Question:** What proportion of the 30 sampled bottles are more than 12 ounces?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.20  
  - b. 0.60  
  - c. 0.50  
  - **d. 0.30**  

About 8/30 or 9/30. Looks like they just rounded to .30? lol.

---

### **33. Which value is most affected by the error?**
- **Question:** In the sample of 30 bottles, the lowest recorded fill is 11.3 ounces, however, originally this value was mistakenly entered as 1.3 ounces. Suppose the error is left uncorrected and the lowest value remains 1.3 ounces. Which value is most affected by the error?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. The Median.  
  - b. The Interquartile Range.  
  - **c. The Mean.**  
  - d. All measurements would be affected the same.  

Definitely not D. The median is largely unaffected by outliers. The IQR doesn’t really change for outliers like this. The mean is the only one that changes from the outliers.

## Use the following for the next four questions. 
The Calla Tulip are large tulips that are often included in a tulip bouquet for enhancement 
benefits. A large nursery grows tulips for florists. The height of the 
tulip is important in making bouquets. The nursery samples 40 tulips 
out of their field and measures their height. See the distribution to the 
right. 
$\bar{x}=40$
![[../../Ignored/Pasted image 20250212224907.png]]
### **34. The distribution of tulip heights is:**
- **Question:** The distribution of tulip heights is:  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. bimodal.  
  - **b. Right-skewed.**  
  - c. Left-skewed.  
  - d. symmetric.  

True. Tail is on the right.

---

### **35. Which probability density function would make the most sense for modeling the height of the calla tulips?**
- **Question:** Which probability density function would make the most sense for modeling the height of the calla tulips?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. Gamma distribution**  
  - b. Binomial distribution  
  - c. Uniform distribution  
  - d. Poisson distribution  

Poisson is events over time so it’s def not that one. Binomial is boolean. Uniform is 1 straight line. Therefore, we say this is gamma like.

---

### **36. True or False. Based on the shape of the distribution, we would expect the median to be larger than the mean.**
- **Question:** True or False. Based on the shape of the distribution, we would expect the median to be larger than the mean.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

I’d say true because the middle of the graph looks to be above the highest bar. Obviously this is false? Why? Is it because in gamma dist, skewed left, the mean is larger than the median?

---

### **37. Match the features of the boxplot with the corresponding letter.**
- **Question:** Match the features of the boxplot with the corresponding letter.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Median:** B  
  - **Outlier:** D  
  - **First Quartile:** E  
  - **Minimum (non-outlier):** C  
  - **Third Quartile:** A  
  - **Maximum (non-outlier):** F

### Use the following for the next two questions. 
The time it takes to heat a microwaveable burrito to an internal temperature of 160℉ is normally distributed with a mean of 65 seconds and a standard deviation of 5 seconds. 
### **38. What is the probability it will take less than 60 seconds to heat a burrito to 160°F?**
- **Question:** The time it takes to heat a microwaveable burrito to an internal temperature of 160°F is normally distributed with a mean of 65 seconds and a standard deviation of 5 seconds. What is the probability it will take less than 60 seconds to heat a burrito to 160°F?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. 0.16**  
  - b. -1.00  
  - c. 0.68  
  - d. 0.18  

$\micro = 65$, $\sigma = 5$, $z=60$
normal distribution
`pnorm(60, 65, 5) = .158`

---

### **39. What is the likelihood the average time will be less than 60 seconds?**
- **Question:** Suppose you have a bag of 4 burritos. Consider this bag to be a random sample of size 4. You cook each of the burritos to 160°F, what is the likelihood the average time will be less than 60 seconds?  
	- $n=4$, sample size
	- $\bar{x}=60$, this is not 4 because sample and $\mu$ have to be in the same units. sample meann
	- $\mu=65$
	- $\sigma=5$
	- $\sigma_x=4/\sqrt{5}$, this is the formula for converting population sigma to sample sigma
	- I would get this wrong again. Make sure to keep noticing if something is population or sample. Keep track of the units and use the correct symbols. They’re there for a reason.
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.157  
  - b. 0.029  
  - c. 0.097  
  - **d. 0.023**  
$n=4$, $\micro = 65$, $\sigma = 5$, $P(x < 60) = .158$
We find the probability with pnorm using our new standard deviation. You must remember that sample and population standard deviations are different. Always convert.
We can calculate sample std deviation with $\sigma / \sqrt{n} = 2.5$. 
Thus `pnorm(60, 65, 2.5) = .0227`

### Use the following for questions two questions
The time it takes to travel between two campuses of a 
university in a city via shuttle bus takes an average 24 
minutes. The distribution of all times is positively 
skewed with a standard deviation of 12. Suppose a 
random sample of 36 transport times are recorded during 
a given week
$\mu = 24$, $\sigma=12$, positively skewed gamma
$n=36$, $s=2$
### **40. Which plot represents the distribution of sample means for a sample size of 36?**
- **Question:** Which plot represents the distribution of sample means for a sample size of 36?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. Plot A  
  - **b. Plot B**  
  - c. Plot C  
  - d. Plot D  

~~Why is this Plot B? I just simply can’t agree. It’s plot C for me. Is it because it’s a dist of sample means and not the actual data?~~
It’s because it’s the sampling distribution.  We can easily elim A and C. B and D are the hard parts. It’s B because D takes the population SD and that’s just not right. If we wanna be accurate, we can do $\sigma_x/\sqrt{n} = 12/6 = 2$. This gives us our new sample SD. Again, remember sample vs population.

### **56. Describe the distribution using context and terms for the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.**
- **Question:** Lionfish are native to indo-pacific waters but the fish were introduced into the Atlantic in the 1990s. These spiny fish have huge appetites, feed on native species, and have and typically have an average length of 13.5 inches. Recently, invasive Lionfish were found 300 feet below the water’s surface off of the coast of Florida. There was some speculation that these fish were larger than previously observed. A random sample of 25 lionfish was obtained close to Fort Lauderdale. The length of each specimen was recorded in inches. The data below shows the distribution of fish lengths. Use the plot and the R output to answer whether there is evidence to suggest the true mean length of Lionfish in this area near Florida is greater than the 13.5. Use a significance level of .05 and assume the underlying population is normal. Describe the distribution using context and terms for the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** The length of Lionfish near Florida is centered above 13.5 inches, with slight positive but overall symmetric distribution. The length of Lionfish near Florida ranges approximately from 5 inches to 27.5 inches.

### **59. Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.**
- **Question:** Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:**  
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times \frac{4.40}{\sqrt{25}}$
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times .88$
    $16.28 \pm 1.82$
    **95% CI:** (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches)  

Question 59 - Lesson 28: Estimation: The Population Mean
Solution:
We use the formula for t confidence intervals below since we don’t know $\sigma$:
$$\bar{x} \pm t_{n-1,a/2}\times\frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}$$
For a 95% confidence interval and 24 df, our t crit value would be 2.064. I had trouble calculating this with R using `qt(97.5,24)` because it gave me NaN’s so I just used the t-table provided in week 5. However, let me remind you that it’s 97.5 because $2.5 \times 2 = 5$.
From reading the problem, we know that $n=25$ because there are 25 lionfish in the sample.
Afterwards, we are given all of the values so we can just sub the values in appropriately. $${16.28} \pm 2.064\times\frac{4.4}{\sqrt{25}}$$
$${16.28} \pm 1.816$$
Answer:
For a 95% confidence interval, $[14.464, 18.096]$

### **60. Summarize your conclusions in the context of the problem.**
- **Question:** **Summary:** There is convincing evidence that the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches (alternative hypothesis). We reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level (p-value = 0.002). The 95% confidence interval for the mean length is (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches), and the point estimate is 16.27 inches, indicating that the true mean length is likely between 14.46 and 18.10 inches.
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** There is convincing evidence the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches. The sample estimates the average Lionfish to be 16.27 inches with a 95% confidence interval from 14.46 inches to 18.10 inches. The null hypothesis is rejected. The one-sided t-test resulted in a significant p-value of 0.002 from a test statistic of 3.16 with 24 df.
