## **Questions**

### **1. Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.**
- **Question:** Under a standard normal density, 50% of the data falls below the mean.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False 

Question 1 - Lesson 14: The Standard Normal Distribution
Solution: This is true because it is a bell curve, highlighted by “standard normal density.” For example, if it was skewed, there is no guarantee that the half of the datapoints would be below the mean.
Answer: True

---

### **2. A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, n, increases.**
- **Question:** A confidence interval is less precise as the sample size, $n$, increases.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

It’s more precise because there are more samples.

---

### **3. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.**
- **Question:** The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, provided by the data.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

This is true because as the p-value gets smaller, we say that there is either (convincing < .01, moderately suggestive < .05, slightly suggestive < .10) evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. And if it is below the alpha value, we can reject the null hypothesis.

---

### **4. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.**
- **Question:** If events A and B are mutually exclusive, they must also be independent.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

Mutually exclusive means that they cannot occur at the same time.
Independent means that they do not affect each other.
While, to me, it may seem true at first, if they cannot occur at the same time, then that means that they are affecting each other in some way.

### **5. The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.**
- **Question:** The symbols $\bar{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are unknown characteristics from a population.  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. True  
  - **b. False**  

X bar means sample mean
p hat means sample proportion

Population parameters - $\micro$, $p$, $\sigma$
Sample statistics - $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}$, $s$

---

### **6. When n is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean p and standard deviation $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.**
- **Question:** When $n$ is large, the sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. True**  
  - b. False  

Also called standard error, as n increases, the variability of the sampling dist decreases.
E(x) = $\micro$
SD(x) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

I actually have no idea about this.
So $p$ is proportion and this talks about it. We know that when n is alrge, np and n(1-p) must be $\geq$ 10. Thus, we can say the the distribution is normal and has a mean of p, along with the standard deviation stated.

### **7. Which Venn Diagram correctly depicts $P(A) = 0.30$, $P(B) = 0.40$, $P(A \text{ AND } B) = 0.15$?**
- **Question:** Which Venn Diagram correctly depicts $P(A) = 0.30$, $P(B) = 0.40$, $P(A \text{ AND } B) = 0.15$?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. Diagram 1  
  - b. Diagram 2  
  - **c. Diagram 3**
  - d. Diagram 4

Remember that outer circle + inner circle/middle must equal the total probability.

### **8. What is the probability either A or B or both events occur?**
- **Question:** What is the probability either A or B or both events occur?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.70  
  - b. 0.85
  - **c. 0.55**  
  - d. 0.45  

This is a classic A union B. I think that Bayes theorem is “what is a chance of A given that B happens (A|B)”
We can get the formula for P(A U B). It’s P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). We have all the venn diagrams we need here

- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.398  
  - **b. 0.631**  
  - c. 2.68  
  - d. 7.98  

${\sigma}^2 = V(x) = E(x^2) - |E(x)|^2$
$\sigma = \sqrt{V(x)}$

$E(x) = 0 + .03 + (2*.2) + (3*.75) = 2.68$
$E(x^2) = 0 + .03 + (2^2*.2) + (3^2*.75) = 7.58$
$V(x) = 7.58 - 2.68^2 = .3976$
$\sigma = \sqrt{.3976} = .631$

Use the following to answer the next 2 questions. 
The number of cars entering a roadway at a specific exit during the morning rush hour traffic (6AM to 9AM, M-F) is a random variable with an average of 6 cars per minute. Suppose the number of cars entering the roadway is the random variable X. 
### **16. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?**
- **Question:** The number of cars entering a roadway at a specific exit during the morning rush hour traffic (6AM to 9AM, M-F) is a random variable with an average of 6 cars per minute. Suppose the number of cars entering the roadway is the random variable X. Which discrete distribution will appropriately model X?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Poisson**

Poisson models occurrences over time
Binomial models successes over trials (where it’s either yes or no).

Since this is 6 per minute, it’s 6 occurrences per unit of time. Therefore, it’s a poisson structure.

---

### **17. What is the probability the number of cars entering the roadway is between 4 and 6 cars per minute (inclusive)?**
- **Question:** What is the probability the number of cars entering the roadway is between 4 and 6 cars per minute (inclusive)?  
- **Answer:**  
  - a. 0.8925  
  - **b. 0.4551**  
  - c. 0.2945  
  - d. 0.1606  

We use the pmf $P(x) = \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}$.
$\lambda = 6$ and $P(4 \leq x \leq 6)$
$$\frac{6^6e^{-6}}{6!}+\frac{6^5e^{-6}}{5!}+\frac{6^4e^{-6}}{4!}=.4551$$
Note that we add the probabilities here because we are using the pmf which calculates for $P(X=x)$ (a point/exact) while the cdf calculates for $P(X \leq x)$. 
We can do `ppois(6, lambda=6) - ppois(3, lambda=6)` if we want to use R and the cdf.

  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$
- **Answer:**  
  - a. Probability density functions can’t be piece-wise functions.  
  - b. The variable should be x not y.  
  - c. The range of the r.v. can only be from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

### **20. What is the probability X will be less than 1.2?**
- **Question:** What is the probability X will be less than 1.2?  
- **Answer:**  
  - **a. 0.634**  
  - b. 0.421  
  - c. 0.579  
  - d. 0.113  

Question 20 - Lesson 8: Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Solution:
Since we know the CDF from the previous question, we can calculate this easily. We take the CDF since it’s *cumulative* and takes the area corresponding to the left side. Since we are calculating the probability that X will be less than 1.2, this matches up perfectly. Thus we can just substitute the value in. If we had the wrong CDF, then this would also be wrong so it’s important to integrate properly while keeping in mind the limits. I mistakenly put the CDF as $-x^{-3}$ the first time and got this one wrong in my corrections too because of that. So be careful!

### **56. Describe the distribution using context and terms for the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.**
- **Question:** Lionfish are native to indo-pacific waters but the fish were introduced into the Atlantic in the 1990s. These spiny fish have huge appetites, feed on native species, and have and typically have an average length of 13.5 inches. Recently, invasive Lionfish were found 300 feet below the water’s surface off of the coast of Florida. There was some speculation that these fish were larger than previously observed. A random sample of 25 lionfish was obtained close to Fort Lauderdale. The length of each specimen was recorded in inches. The data below shows the distribution of fish lengths. Use the plot and the R output to answer whether there is evidence to suggest the true mean length of Lionfish in this area near Florida is greater than the 13.5. Use a significance level of .05 and assume the underlying population is normal. Describe the distribution using context and terms for the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** The length of Lionfish near Florida is centered above 13.5 inches, with slight positive but overall symmetric distribution. The length of Lionfish near Florida ranges approximately from 5 inches to 27.5 inches.

### **59. Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.**
- **Question:** Calculate the 95% confidence interval provided $\bar{x} = 16.28$ inches and $s = 4.40$ inches.  
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:**  
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times \frac{4.40}{\sqrt{25}}$
    $16.28 \pm 2.064 \times .88$
    $16.28 \pm 1.82$
    **95% CI:** (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches)  

Question 59 - Lesson 28: Estimation: The Population Mean
Solution:
We use the formula for t confidence intervals below since we don’t know $\sigma$:
$$\bar{x} \pm t_{n-1,a/2}\times\frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}$$
For a 95% confidence interval and 24 df, our t crit value would be 2.064. I had trouble calculating this with R using `qt(97.5,24)` because it gave me NaN’s so I just used the t-table provided in week 5. However, let me remind you that it’s 97.5 because $2.5 \times 2 = 5$.
From reading the problem, we know that $n=25$ because there are 25 lionfish in the sample.
Afterwards, we are given all of the values so we can just sub the values in appropriately. $${16.28} \pm 2.064\times\frac{4.4}{\sqrt{25}}$$
$${16.28} \pm 1.816$$
Answer:
For a 95% confidence interval, $[14.464, 18.096]$

### **60. Summarize your conclusions in the context of the problem.**
- **Question:** **Summary:** There is convincing evidence that the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches (alternative hypothesis). We reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level (p-value = 0.002). The 95% confidence interval for the mean length is (14.46 inches, 18.10 inches), and the point estimate is 16.27 inches, indicating that the true mean length is likely between 14.46 and 18.10 inches.
- **Answer:**  
  - **Answer:** There is convincing evidence the average length of Lionfish near Florida is greater than 13.5 inches. The sample estimates the average Lionfish to be 16.27 inches with a 95% confidence interval from 14.46 inches to 18.10 inches. The null hypothesis is rejected. The one-sided t-test resulted in a significant p-value of 0.002 from a test statistic of 3.16 with 24 df.
