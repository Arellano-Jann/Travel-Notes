### **60. Both charts show points that are out of control, which chart should we be more concerned with the process, and why?**
- **Question:** Both charts show points that are out of control, which chart should we be more concerned with the process, and why?  
- **Answer:**  
  - Plot One. This chart shows a very extreme point for sub-sample 27.  
  - Plot One. This chart shows too much variability and the control limits are too extreme.  
  - **Plot Two. This chart shows the proportion of defective bricks is increasing for batches that are sampled later in the process.**
