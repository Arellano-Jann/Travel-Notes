The dataset ExamDataW24.csv represents the midterm and final exam grades for students in the ST314 online and campus courses for three previous consecutive terms. Use these data to complete a regression analysis in R and answer the following questions. 

Part 1. Describing the relationship between your two variables

a. (2 points) Graphically: Make a scatterplot of the relationship between ST314 student midterm grades (explanatory variable) and final exam grades (response variable). Include your plot in your submission. Describe in context the relationship from the scatterplot. Include strength, direction, form and outliers (if any). 

b. (2 points) Numerically: Calculate the correlation coefficient . Report the value of and describe in context the strength of the relationship based on your value. 

Part 2. Calculate the Least Square Regression Line (Model) and Check Conditions for Inference

a. (3 points) Using R, calculate the least squares regression line that predicts final exam scores from midterm exam scores for ST314 students. Paste the R output for the model summary. Separately, state the least squares regression line (model) using statistical notation. Only pasting your R output without reporting the least squares regression line will not earn you points. 

b. (4 points) Plot the residuals for the model. Include a reference line at 0. Include your plot in your submission. Check the linearity, normality and constant variation conditions using the residual plot. State why each condition is met or why it is not met. 

c. (4 points) Using your linear model, predict what the final score would be for a student who received a 84grade on the midterm, on average.

Part 3. Is your model a good fit? Use your R output from the model in Part 2a. From the output, is there statistical evidence midterm exam score is a significant predictor of final exam score? Use a significance level of 0.05. 

a. (2 points) State the null and alternative hypothesis for the individual t test on the slope. 

b. (2 points) State the test statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value from the output. 

c. (2 points) Make a conclusion. Include context, a statement in terms of the alternative and whether to reject the null based on the level of significance.   

d. (2 points) Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the slope. Interpret the point and interval estimate for
