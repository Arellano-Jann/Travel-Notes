Part 1. (18 Points) 

On Canvas, you’ll find the R script, One_Variable_Display_and_Summary_Stats.R and the ST314 student survey dataset, st314_student_survey.csv. You’ll use both of these to explore one categorical and one quantitative variable from the survey. Download the R script and the dataset, open the R script and follow the command instructions. Then answer the following questions: 

Categorical Variable 

The variable “Major” describes the individual’s major in school. The variable “Phone” identifies the type of phone the individual has (iOS, Android, other). Both of these variables are categorical. Select one of the two categorical variables just mentioned and answer the following three questions.

a. (1 point) Choose a categorical variable to explore. Which variable did you choose? 

b. (2 point) Paste the table of counts and bar chart for the categorical variable of your choosing. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot. 

c. (2 point) Briefly, describe the distribution in context. Recall, categorical variables are summarized by counts and/or percents. 

Quantitative Variable

The variable “Credit Hours” indicates the number of credit hours the individual was enrolled in during the term the survey was completed. The variable “Gaming Hours” describes approximately how many hours a week the survey participant games. Both of these variables are quantitative. Select one of the two quantitative variables just mentioned and answer the following three questions.

a. (1 point) Choose a quantitative variable to explore. Which variable did you choose? Is the variable discrete or continuous?

b. (2 point) Create a histogram of the variable. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot. Paste plot. 

c. (2 point) Create a boxplot of the variable. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot. Paste plot. 

d. (1 point) Which plot do you prefer (histogram or boxplot) to visualize the variable? Why? 

e. (2 points) Give a table that includes the mean, standard deviation, minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rdquartile, maximum and IQR. 

f. (3 points) Use the plots and summary statistics to describe the data in the context of the problem. Include the shape, center and spread in your description. State whether there are any outliers. 

g. (2 points) Given the shape of the data which measure, the mean, median or either, would be a more appropriate to represent the center of the data? Explain your reasoning.   

Part 2. (5 points)

Using the code provided in the One_Variable_Display_and_Summary_Stats.R script, take a simple random sample of 10 students from the class data. Consider the same quantitative variable you chose in part 1. 

a. (1 point) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of your sample. 

b. (2 point) Make a boxplot or histogram of the sample data. Give the plot a title and change the color of the plot from the plot in part 1. Paste plot. 

c. (2 points) How different are your sampled statistics in comparison to the overall class mean and standard deviation? How different is the distribution?
