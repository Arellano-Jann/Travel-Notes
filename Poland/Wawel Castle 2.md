Full of paintings
You go through the first floor on the right where you see some portraits and stuff.
Afterwards you go to the second floor and see the rest. You can actually sneak into the first floor in your way to the second floor here if thereâ€™s no security guard. That should be quite rare though. I almost did it lol but the security guard was there.
