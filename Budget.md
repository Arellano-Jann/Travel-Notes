**__Left money:__** 
__**Liquid - Total = Left** = 2.5k__ - Minimum amount of money you have taking into account all expenses
**LiquidAll - Total = Left** = 8.5k - Optimal Money amount given scholarships and side job
**Liquid - Hard = Left** = 11.5k - Minimum amount of money without taking into account buffers
**LiquidAll - Hard = Left** = 17.5k - Optimal money amount when not taking into account buffers

this essentially means, i have "32k" for my trip. whatever the fuck that means. i'd like to spend less and have the least amount of expenses while having the most fun possible. this means being wise about spending on food. also wise on flights and also wise on hostels. most of all, it means that i need to be wise on entertainment and bills that are "big luxuries" things like transportation costs.
split up between the 3 stages of the trip
it's 8k in spain, 8k in backpacking, 8k in japan
the other 8k will be for safety precautions but we will hope that we dont need to touch that money. that money will basically be the tax refund that i'm tryna get


17.6k - Japan (4789 + 850 + 4000 + 8000 = tuition + programFee + housing6month + personalCosts)
